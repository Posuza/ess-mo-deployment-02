# Servy Full-Stack Deployment Manager

Automates installing the **ESS MO** app (Vue frontend + FastAPI backend + Caddy reverse proxy) as Windows services via [Servy](https://github.com/servy-community/servy).

## 📋 Before you begin — config files

Edit these **before** your first deploy if your setup differs from the defaults.

### `deploy.config.json` — settings (ports, paths, repos)

### `deploy.secrtes.json` — settings (credentials)

Created automatically on first run. Edit it to change:

> ⚠️ **Do not use ports** `80`, `443`, `8080`, `3000`, `8000`, `5000` — these are typically taken by other services (IIS, web servers, dev tools). Pick free ports instead. The defaults (`3009`, `8009`, `8089`,....) any of such this never conflict.

| Field | Default | What it does | Can be changed? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FrontendRepo` | `Posuza/ESS_MO_Fronend` | Git repo for the Vue frontend | ✅ Replace with your own repo URL |
| `BackendRepo` | `Posuza/ESS_MO_Backend` | Git repo for the FastAPI backend | ✅ Replace with your own repo URL |
| `FrontendPort` | `3009` | Port the frontend serves on | ✅ Change if needed |
| `BackendPort` | `8009` | Port the backend API runs on | ✅ Change if needed |
| `CaddyPort` | `8089` | Port the reverse proxy listens on | ✅ Change if needed |
| `ApiPrefix` | `/api/v1` | API path prefix | ✅ Any prefix starting with `/` (e.g. `/api`, `/v2`) |
| `InstallRoot` | *(set at startup)* | Where files get installed (e.g. `C:\Ess_Mo`) | ✅ Set at startup or edit in config |

### `deploy.secrets.json` — credentials (DB, SMTP)

Auto-gitignored. Copy `deploy.secrets.example.json` → `deploy.secrets.json` to pre-fill, or enter them when the script prompts you.

```json
{
  "db":   { "host": "192.168.1.140", "port": "3306", "name": "ess", "user": "root", "password": "..." },
  "smtp": { "host": "smtp.gmail.com", "port": "587", "user": "...", "pass": "...", "from": "..." }
}
```

> If you skip pre-filling, the script will ask for these interactively.

---

## 🚀 Step-by-step installation guide

### 1. Prepare credentials

Before running the script, make sure your DB and SMTP credentials are ready.
You can either:

- **Pre-fill** `deploy.secrets.json` with your real values (copy from `deploy.secrets.example.json`)
- **Or let the script prompt you** — it will ask for credentials at the start of the deployment

> The script never blocks — if you skip entering credentials, it uses defaults that you can update later.

### 2. Run the script

Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to the folder first
cd C:\path\to\ess-mo

# Run
.\deploy.ps1
```

If execution policy blocks it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "filepath\deploy.ps1"
```

### 3. Set install location (first run only)

You'll be asked to pick a **drive** (e.g. `C:`, `D:`). The script creates `Ess_Mo` folder there (`C:\Ess_Mo`).

### 4. Use the main menu

```
 1) Check prerequisites
 2) Install components
 3) Uninstall components
 4) Service status / health check
 5) Start services
 6) Stop services
 7) Caddy network config
 8) Open logs folder
 Q) Quit
```

---

### 4. Install everything

Press **`2`** then **`A`** to install all components (or pick individually by number).

The script will:
1. Check prerequisites (Git, Node.js, Python) — installs missing ones
2. Ask for DB/SMTP credentials (if not pre-filled)
3. Install each component:
   - **Frontend** — clones repo, `npm install`, builds, registers as Windows service
   - **Backend** — clones repo, creates venv, `pip install`, generates `.env`, registers as service
   - **Caddy** — downloads Caddy, creates `Caddyfile`, registers as service
4. Optionally start all services and verify health

## 🔧 Caddy network config (option 7)

Use **option 7** to manage which services Caddy proxies to:

```
 Caddy listener : 127.0.0.1:8089

 Available targets:
   (all targets already registered)

 Caddy routes:
   1) /*         → 127.0.0.1:3009  [Frontend]
   2) /api/v1/*  → 127.0.0.1:8009  [Backend]

 1) Add route to Caddy
 2) Remove route from Caddy
 3) Change Caddy listening port
 B) Back to main menu
```

- **Add route** — pick an available service (frontend, backend, or custom), specify a path prefix, confirm. Caddyfile regenerates and Caddy restarts.
- **Remove route** — pick a route by number, confirm removal.
- **Change port** — update the port Caddy listens on.

## 🤖 Headless / automated mode

```powershell
# Full deploy — no prompts
.\deploy.ps1 -Force

# Deploy only specific components
.\deploy.ps1 -Force -Components frontend,backend

# Preview only (dry run)
.\deploy.ps1 -DryRun

# Preview specific components
.\deploy.ps1 -DryRun -Components frontend,backend
```

> Make sure `deploy.config.json` and `deploy.secrets.json` exist and are configured before running headless.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| **Script won't run** | Use `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\deploy.ps1` |
| **Service won't uninstall** | Restart Windows, then re-run uninstall |
| **Port conflict** | Change Caddy port in option 7 (option 3) or edit `deploy.config.json` |
| **Frontend build fails** | Check `logs/frontend_build.log` in the install directory |
| **Backend won't start** | Check `logs/backend_pip.log` and verify `.env` has correct DB credentials |
| **Logs location** | `<InstallRoot>\logs\deploy-YYYYMMDD-HHmmss.log` |
